#  some hikers in the Alps stumbled across the corpse of a man who had died about 3300 B.C.E.
#  the media called him “the Iceman” and nicknamed him Otzi 
# He was 160 cm
# an axe with a copper head and yew-wood handle
# a flint-bladed knife with a wooden handle
# a pouch filled with materials that may have been a fire-starting kit,
# an unfinished bow of yew wood (longer than its owner was tall),with 14 arrows
# He wore a fur-lined cap
# a vest of pelts stitched together
# a leather loincloth, a leather belt, fur leggings, a cloak woven of grasses, and what appear to have been large snow shoes—with bearskin soles, cow-hide uppers, and an insulating layer of grass. His body bore 57 tattoos, and he sported an ornament or talisman suspended on a leather thong—a doughnut-shaped disk of white marble.
# he eat probably venison
# His death was not from natural causes. A flint arrowhead about an inch long was lodged about 3 inches under his left shoulder near his lung.


 #Nomadic gatherers sometimes sowed seeds before they left a region to
#ensure a crop when they returned, and hunters, who trapped animals, knew that some
#species would feed and breed in captivity
# the transition to farming reduced life spans. # It increased the yield of food from a given plot of land.
